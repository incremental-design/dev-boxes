## Installation:

Add `box-base` to your codebase.
asciicast, video or GIF of adding to your project and using it

## Usage:

[ ] Make a bulleted list of each class, method, or function that your project exports. Link each list item directly to the file that defines it.

### How `box-base` works:

[ ] Explain how execution works. What is the entry point for your code? Which files correspond to which functionality? What is the lifecycle of your project? Are there any singletons, side effects or shared state among instances of your project? Take extra care to explain design decisions. After all, you wrote an ENTIRE codebase around your opinions. Make sure that your repository's contributors understand them.

## Roadmap:

[ ] List the releases that you have added to each project, and any future releases you would like to do. If there is a date for future release, put it here. If not, let people know that there is no defined timeframe for future releases.

## Contribute to `box-base`:

See [`dev-boxes/README.md`](../../README.md#contribute-to-dev-boxes).
